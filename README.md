# Create-Skyblock-Addon
This mod is made for the modpack "[Create Skyblock Mordrinth Edition](https://modrinth.com/modpack/create-skyblock)" which is also made by me (lassilos) at this point of development it only adds a few items like: 

-Dirty copper Powder which is used with washing to get copper powder

-Powdered copper which makes it possible to make a copper automated copper farm

-incomplete netherite nuggets which are just used in the recipe for netherite

This mod has no dependencies but the items are only possible to get and used in the intended way, you need to have the modpack installed.
(I plan to add every custom addition from the modpack into the mod so that it is easier to use)
